# SHACAL2-Python
Python implementation of SHACAL-2. SHACAL-2 is a cipher based on the SHA-256 hash function. It has a 512 bit key and a 256 bit block size. This is part of my project to implement interesting ciphers in python so people can learn more about them. A script like this is not secure under many instances due to side-channels.
